### Welcome to the demo recipes of the Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW) Project ###

The language habits of Taiwanese people are different from other Mandarin speakers (both accents and cultures, especially Tainwaese use tranditional Chinese characters, i.e., 繁體中文). So we proposed a corpus collection project "Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)" in order to boost the development of Taiwan-specific speech recognition techniques.

FSW is a large-scale database of real-Life/multi-gene Taiwanese Spontaneous speech collected and transcribed from various sources (radio, TV, open courses, etc.). To demostrate that this database is a reasonable data resource for Taiwanese spontaneous speech recognition research, a baseline recipes is provied here for new researchers, and especially students to develop their systems easily and quickly.

This recips is based on the "NER-Trs-Vol1" corpus (126.6 hours broadcast radio speech selected from FSW. For more details, please visit:
